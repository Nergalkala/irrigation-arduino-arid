Simple schematics, note the light sensor that isn't wired since I can't get it to work with the rest of the project.

But the code, DHT and the RTC, still gets the desired outcome, since anyways the light intensity it is not a good idea
To water your plants when it's 34ÂºC in the afternoon, whatever the amount of light.
In the future i will rectify it, but for the moment it is as good as it gets.
